# Password Generator Starter Code
## Module_3 bootcamp assignment 

In this assignment I created an app that can generate a random password.

It assignment asked me to use window prompts, but I wanted to challenge myself with CSS and what I already knew about the DOM.

Users can select the length of desired password with the slider, and select what type characters that they want in thier password. 

When the click the generate password button, the password appears. 

One character selection in required, I added a error validation if one is not selected. 

The password is generated from the built array of users selections, then shuffled to increase the randomness.

I had to do a lot of debugging to get the password working right! It was kind of fun actually!
